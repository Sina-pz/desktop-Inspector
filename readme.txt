Note:
Permission:

By Default: If the user is running the application, your application inherits the same permissions as the user account. This includes read access to files in the userâ€™s Desktop folder.
Explicit Permission: It's always a good practice to ask for permission before accessing or processing user data, even if technically possible.
Display a Prompt: You can show a message asking for the user's consent to inspect the desktop folder.
